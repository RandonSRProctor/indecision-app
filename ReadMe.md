# Overview

**Indescision App** is a basic React App that randomly chooses an item from multiple, user provided items.

A simple solution to helping those who are stuck with decision anxiety.

This is the first practice app in a series that **Randy Proctor** is creating from lessons created by **Andrew Mead**.

# Important Note on Outdated Practices

This application likely features outdated syntax expressions from pre-ES6 JS, and I have left them outdated intentionally.

Part of the lesson path is to practice older and new standards so that I can: 
- Understand *why* the new standards are so important
- Be more prepared to optimize legacy code
- Have a deeper understanding of how code changes over time

If you would like to further discuss optimization, standards, or code-practices in general, please feel free to email me.  I always love talking shop!
